In constructing this program, preprocessing was an important element in achieving optimal performance while conducting training. Proper preprocessing methods that include data normalization, scaling, and data cleaning aid in lessening the noise and nonessential details present in the data, thereby improving the model's accuracy and assembling it more efficiently and effectively.

To prepare this dataset for training, each pixel value is normalized by dividing it by 255. This process scales the pixel values to a range of 0 to 1, which helps numerical stability and faster convergence during training. By normalizing the data, neural networks can learn more efficiently and accurately identify handwritten digits.
